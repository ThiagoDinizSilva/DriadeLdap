This project idea is to create a simple interface to manage ldap/samba databases. Allowing you to do operations in varios users or groups 
with a simple click The Idea is to access the linux(CentOS 7) server and manage ldap with ssh and smbldap-tools such as smbldap-useradd and 
smbldap-groupadd it will have a login interface and credential management. maybe in the future i'll try to create a rpm package

---Version 0.4---

now trying to get a login interface to work. the server now connects with my linux and can execute cli by alter the value of "cli" in Function 
Use located in src/config/cli.js

---Version v0.5.3---

placed some comments down the code as it started to grow bigger, rebased everything to get things more organized, next step is to model
a DB and use it to get things work. Got some experience ussing passport npm, I'll try improve it somehow
